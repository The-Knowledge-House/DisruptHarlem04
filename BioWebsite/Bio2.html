	<p>Hello, my name is Morgan Fox. I am a 19 year old female who grew up in Harlem. While growing up I was always fascinated with technology. My mother, Trenace Green, worked in IT and I would often accompany her while she worked on servers. These experiences led me to want to pursue a career within the technological field. During my high school years I was part of a robotics team, The HEAFIN8TORS. My time within the team helped me narrow down my technological interest to coding. After high school I went to a school in Alabama, Talladega College, to pursue a Bachelors degree in Computer Science. I am currently on a break from school, however I wish to soon continue pursuing my degree.</p>
